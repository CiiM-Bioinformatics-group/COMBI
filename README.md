## Abstract
Föhse, K., Geckin, B., Zoodsma, M et al. 

The mRNA-based BNT162b2 protects against severe disease and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2. It induces specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but much less is known about its broad effects on immune responses against other pathogens. In the present study, we investigated both the specific adaptive immune responses induced by BNT162b2 vaccination against various SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as its effects on the responsiveness of human immune cells upon stimulation with heterologous viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. First, BNT162b2 vaccination induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but this started to wane after six months. Second, the BNT162b2 vaccine modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells when stimulated with various microbial stimuli other than SARS-CoV-2: the production of cytokines from IL-1/IL-6 pathway was generally higher after BNT162b2 vaccination, while the production of IFN-α was decreased. Third, long-term changes were also observed in the transcriptional programs of immune cells after vaccination, as assessed by RNA-sequencing. Altogether, we observed a lasting modulation of innate immune response after vaccination, and these data increase our knowledge regarding the broad immunological effects of this new class of vaccines.
